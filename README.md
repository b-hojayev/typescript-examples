# TypeScript Examples

This repository contains my solutions to various tasks from the **official TypeScript documentation**.

## Structure

- The repo is organized into folders, each representing a specific **TypeScript topic** (e.g., Classes, Generics, Conditional Types, etc.).
- Inside each folder, you'll find files with **multiple example tasks** related to that topic.
- Each file demonstrates TypeScript concepts through small, focused examples.

## Purpose

This is my personal practice space to:

- Learn and reinforce TypeScript concepts.
- Build a quick reference for future projects.
- Experiment with TypeScript syntax and features.

## TO RUN CODE TYPE: npx ts-node filename
